# Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome.

## Development

With Nix, `nix develop` (or direnv) gives you the toolchain and installs the
pre-commit hooks. Before opening a PR, make sure these pass:

```
cargo test --workspace
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
nix fmt
nix flake check
```

Arguments are parsed with `bpaf` (derive). Money is integer minor units.

## Ground rules

- Keep the ordering safety gates intact: the submit URL is only allowlisted
  with `allow_ordering = true`, `grab food order` / `grab mart order` need
  `--yes <quote-id>` or an interactive confirm, and the submit endpoint is
  never retried.
- Test fixtures must be synthetic. Never commit cookies, tokens, session files,
  captured network traffic, real addresses or coordinates, phone numbers, order
  or booking ids, or payment details. Scrub anything recorded from the live API
  before adding it.
- Be gentle with Grab's API: no tight polling, back off on `429`.
